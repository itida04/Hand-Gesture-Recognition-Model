# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Model
This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system that classifies various gestures using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built for applications in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), it leverages image processing and deep learning to recognize gestures captured via a camera. The project covers data collection, training, and testing, with live performance evaluations.

**Project Overview -
The model is trained on images of different hand gestures collected and processed in real time. This dataset of hand gestures is augmented and normalized to improve model accuracy and generalize better across varied inputs. The core idea is to preprocess images, train a CNN classifier, and deploy it for real-time gesture recognition, making it a versatile tool for gesture-based interactions.

Model Structure -
The CNN model architecture includes several convolutional and max-pooling layers to extract spatial features, followed by fully connected layers for gesture classification. The model was built using TensorFlow and Keras, allowing efficient training and accuracy tuning.

Steps Involved -
1) Data Collection: We collected images for each gesture class (e.g., "down," "fist," "okay," etc.) to create a labeled dataset. Each class consists of multiple images captured at various angles.

2) Data Preprocessing:
Resizing and Grayscale Conversion: Images are resized to a standard dimension (300x300) and converted to grayscale for consistent input processing.
Data Augmentation: To enhance model robustness, we augment images using transformations like rotations and shifts.

4) Model Training:
The CNN model is trained on the processed dataset using Keras with real-time data augmentation, enabling it to generalize well across different conditions and gestures.
The model's training parameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) are tuned for optimal accuracy.

6) Real-Time Testing:
For testing, the model is deployed to classify gestures in real-time, using OpenCV to capture live images, which are then fed into the model for immediate prediction.

**Text-to-Speech Integration:
*  Adding a text-to-speech module would allow the system to audibly describe recognized gestures, making it more accessible for users who prefer auditory feedback.
*  Libraries such as pyttsx3 or Google Text-to-Speech API could be integrated to convert output text into speech.
